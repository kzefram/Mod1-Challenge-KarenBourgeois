# Mod1-Challenge-KarenBourgeois

## Description

This challenge is to demonstrate my knowledge of making a site accessible to screen readers, the structure of HTML, and adding the appropriate HTML tags.

## Installation

There is no installation required as this is a static website.

## Usage

This is my first challenge/assignment for Module 1 in the boot camp that I taking. I will be adding the following acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
